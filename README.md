A fast, lightweight, Coverflow-style gallery component for Delphi — fully animated without any 3D engine.
Low CPU usage, easy to integrate, and smooth visual effects even with large image sets.

Features:

Pinterest-like masonry layout
Animated appearance (slide-in, “falling” effect on clear/page change)
Select / focus item and move or zoom it into a target rect
HotTrack & HotZoom hover effects
Smooth transitions, similar in spirit to TMS GUIMotions but much lighter

Works on Delphi 7 and Delphi 11.3
